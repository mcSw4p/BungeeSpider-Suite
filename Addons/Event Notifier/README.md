# BungeeSpider-EventNotifier
The BungeeSpider-EventNotifier(Client) is an addon the monitors TPS, Player Count, Ram Usage, and Disk Usage then uses BungeeSpider-server to send notifications to 
either a single email address or to a assigned group from the Recipients Config on your BungeeSpider-Server server. You can enable and disable each monitor seperatly 
if you desire. Each monitor can be checked with a command on the server aswell.
