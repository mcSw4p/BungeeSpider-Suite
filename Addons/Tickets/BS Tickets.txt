The BungeeSpider Tickets addon is a Addon for BungeeSpider Server. It collects Tickets from Players/Staff and puts them
in a Google Sheets Doc. 

Why a Google Sheets Doc? 

There is a Software called Appsheet that creates a app from Excel/Sheets Doc along with others. This way Administrators/
Moderators can view Tickets from a smart phone over Wireless or Cellular Data. That app can be created just for your 
Network or you could use my Default template.
